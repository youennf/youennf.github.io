Description

This test validates that the performance.measure() method throws a SYNTAX_ERR exception whenever a non-existent mark is provided as the startMark or endMark, and the method also throws a INVALID_ACCESS_ERR whenever a navigation timing attribute with a value of zero is provided as the startMark or endMark.
