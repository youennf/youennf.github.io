PASS Typed Arrays Test: ArrayBuffer properties 
PASS Check if the byteLength is fixed at construction time and readonly 
PASS Check if the new ArrayBuffer contains all bytes from begin to the end of this ArrayBuffer when the end is unspecified 
PASS Check if the new ArrayBuffer contains the bytes from begin to the end of this ArrayBuffer when the end is specified 
PASS Check if the slice range specified by the begin and end values is clamped to the valid index range for the current array 
PASS Check if it refers to an index from the end of the array when either begin or end is negative 
PASS Check if the length is clamped to zero when the computed length of the new ArrayBuffer is negative 
PASS Check if the isView returns true when the value is an object implementing the ArrayBufferView interface 
PASS Check if the isView returns false when the value is an object not implementing the ArrayBufferView interface
