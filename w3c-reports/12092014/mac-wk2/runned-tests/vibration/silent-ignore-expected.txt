Description

This test is only useful on devices that do not have vibration capability. If your device supports vibration, then skip this test. An implementation supporting this API but running on a device that cannot vibrate must silently ignore the call (we test that it doesn't throw).

The feature(s) tested here are known to have been made available via vendor prefixes; you can run this test with vendor prefixes enabled.
